# DS2 save/BND4 editor

Small editor for Dark Souls 2 save files, made because I wanted to do a challenge run where I put a new character on New Game+ 7 immediately.

Logic is copied from [jtesta](https://github.com/jtesta/souls_givifier).

This repo doesn't include the Dark Souls 2 decryption key because I have no interest in enabling multiplayer exploits etc.

The repo is here mainly for my own archival purposes.

If you have a legally-obtained decryption key, you can pass it as an environment variable.
